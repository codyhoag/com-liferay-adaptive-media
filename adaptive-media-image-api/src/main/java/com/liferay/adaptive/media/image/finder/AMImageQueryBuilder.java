 *
 * It's recommended that you use this interface by chaining those methods to
 * create the query with the requirements. These methods can either be:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Initial: must be invoked as the first method in the chain. They can be
 * chained by other methods to add more requirements.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Intermediate: can be chained to an initial method or to another intermediate
 * method to add more requirements.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Terminal: can be chained to both initial or intermediate methods, but they
 * don't accept any more chaining.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
